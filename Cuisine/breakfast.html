		<h2>Chinese Dumplings</h2>
		<p>Chinese dumpling, commonly eaten in China and other parts of East Asia. They are one of the major dishes eaten during the Chinese New Year and year-round in the northern provinces. Though considered part of Chinese cuisine, dumplings are popular in other parts of East Asia and in the Western world, where they are sometimes called “pot stickers”. Nowadays, the lifestyle of Chinese people is becoming more and more diversified, and dumplings have become a popular breakfast.

			Dumplings
		</div>	
		<p>
			Dumplings typically consist of a ground meat and/or vegetable filling wrapped into a thinly rolled piece of dough, which is then sealed by pressing the edges
			together. Finished dumplings can be boiled (水饺), steamed (蒸饺) or pan-fried (煎饺) and are traditionally served with a black vinegar and sesame oil dip. They
			can also be served with soup.
			<br/><br/>
			The main cooking methods for dumplings are boiling, steaming, baking, frying, deep-frying, and grilling.

			<li><span class="bold">Fill</span>  dumpling filling vegetables should not be too much water. Not suitable for dumpling filling vegetables: such as zucchini. But can be used as a steamed dumpling filling.</li>

			When the dumplings are too much to eat at one time, save it for another meal, you can use the frying method, its taste is also very good. It is customary to 
			fry the dumplings in cooking oil. However, the trend is to eat healthier, and foods with more oil are less popular. In fact, dumplings can be fried in water 
			alone, or in broth instead of oil, and they taste great. Pan-fried dumplings are also called pot stickers.

		<h2>Chinese Noodles</h2>
		<p>Noodles originated in China and have been made and eaten for more than 4,000 years. Noodles are easy to make, convenient to eat, nutritious, healthy health food that can be a staple food and a fast food, and have long been accepted and loved by people around the world.
			Noodles are made from flour of cereals or beans, ground into dough with water, and then either pressed or rolled or stretched into slices and then cut or
			pressed, or rolled, pulled, pinched and other means to make strips (narrow or wide, flat or round) or small slices, and finally boiled, fried, braised, fried
			and made into a kind of food. There are many patterns and varieties. Local specialties are extremely rich, such as the longevity noodles eaten to celebrate
			birthdays and the fragrant spaghetti from abroad. Good noodles are almost always mild and al dente, developing the flavor of pasta to the extreme.
