				Rice
		</div>
		<p>Rice is a staple food loved by people in China, and even in East and Southeast Asia, and is made by steaming or simmering rice and the right amount of water. Rice is a food made by boiling rice with water. Rice is the most staple food in East Asia, including China, Japan and Korea. Rice is prepared by adding one cup of rice to one and a half to one cup of water. The rice is cooked to swell appropriately and is fully cooked inside, and the water is removed.
			<br/>
			The introduction of rice can be traced back to congee. Since the water requirement for cooking congee is lower than that of rice, the ancient Chinese people 
			gradually mastered the effect of cooking with different amounts of water and developed a fuller rice. In modern times, as the technology of polishing grains has 
			become more advanced than in ancient times, the rice consumed by the people has gradually changed from brown rice to white rice.

			veritable mountain treasure and wild food. One of the few Northeastern dishes that can be developed into a home-style dish comparable to other high-end dishes.

		<p>Chinese vegetables are dishes made from plant and mushroom foods. Chinese vegetarian cuisine has a long history, it was born in the Spring and Autumn and Warring States period, mainly used for rituals and major ceremonies. In the Wei and Jin Dynasties and the North and South Dynasties, with the introduction of Buddhism, the theory of "vegetarianism" was gradually formed, which played a great role in promoting the development of vegetarian cuisine. Since then, vegetarian cuisine has become its own system, unique and distinctive, and has become an important part of the colorful Chinese cuisine and food culture.
